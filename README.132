1. FILES

This directory contains the files required to processing the Maths 132 notes
using LaTeX.

The source files are

notes.tex		Master LaTeX2e file for notes
ch00-pre.tex		Preface
ch01-ode.tex		Chapter 1: ODEs
ch02-vf.tex		Chapter 2: Vector Functions
ch03-spd.tex		Chapter 3: Single Particle Dynamics
ch04-mpd.tex		Chapter 4: Multiple Particle Dynamics
ch05-rbm.tex		Chapter 5: Rigid Body Motion
ch06-sde.tex		Chapter 6: Systems of DEs
ch06a-pp.tex		Section on phase portraits from ch6; superceded by ch 7
ch07-nlc.tex		Non-Linear Coupled ODEs
phasport.pro		PostScript header file for drawing phase portraits
ps2upnn.pro		PostScript header file for 2-up printing
cover.tex		LaTeX2e file for cover
melbuni.eps		MU logo for cover


The following files are also required to process the notes.  These are 
available from the TeX archive at ftp.cs.rmit.edu.au, but are included here
for convenience.

picinpar.sty		Put pictures inside paragraphs (first fig in sec 7.1)
pstricks.tex		All of the diagrams are done with PSTricks.  These
pstricks.con		are the TeX source files and the PostScript header
pstricks.pro		files needed for PSTricks.
pstricks.bug
pst-coil.tex
pst-coil.pro
pst-node.tex
pst-node.pro

The AMS-LaTeX set of macros is also required.

2. PROCESSING THE NOTES

This description assumes that the 'latex' command runs TeX with the LaTeX2e set
of macros.  These notes are not compatible with LaTeX209, the old version of
LaTeX.

Process and print the cover sheet:

	latex cover
	dvips cover

Depending on how dvips is configured, this will either print the cover page
directly or create the file cover.ps, which can then be printed.

Process and print the body of the notes:

	latex notes
	latex notes

Two runs through LaTeX are needed to resolve the cross-references and to
build the table of contents.  To print the notes, dvips is used with a special
header file to print the pages of the notes two to a sheet of A4 paper.
The command line for dvips is

	dvips -tlandscape -hps2up.pro -x707 -O"-7mm,-7mm" notes

This will either print the notes directly, or leave a file notes.ps, which ca nbe printed.

'-tlandscape' changes the paper's orientation, '-hps2up.pro' includes the
header file ps2up.pro for 2-up printing, '-x707' reduces the size of the 
printed page by 70.7% to account for two A4 pages being printed on each sheet,
and '-O"-7mm,-7mm"' is an adjustment to dvips's standard 1in offset from the
top left corner of the page.  

If a 600 dpi printer is being used, dvips looks for fonts at 424 dpi
(600x0.707) because of the 70.7% magnification.  Since these are not usually
part of the standard set of fonts, dvips will call METAFONT to create the 
bitmapped fonts it needs.  This is a slow process first time around, but if
the fonts are cached somewhere, they will be available next time around.
If the font generation is not working, existing 300 or 600 dpi fonts can be
used, by including a command line option of '-D424' or '-D848'.  This works
because '-D424' tells dvips that the printer is a 424dpi printer.  Since
the pages are reduced to 70.7%, dvips sends the printer 424x0.707=300 dpi
fonts because this gives an effctive resolution of 424 dpi when the pages are
scaled.
