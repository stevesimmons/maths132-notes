Publishing Company, fifth edition, 1993.
\item Fowles, G. R., {\em Analytical Mechanics}, Holt Rinehart Winston,
third edition, 1977.
\end{itemize}

While the exact page references in these notes refer to the editions listed 
above, earlier editions cover much the same material with slightly different 
page and section numbering.
